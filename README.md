### What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```
id7/
├── css/
│   ├── id7.css
│   ├── id7.css.map
│   ├── id7.min.css
│   ├── id7-default-theme.css
│   ├── id7-default-theme.css.map
│   └── id7-default-theme.min.css
├── js/

│   └── fontawesome-webfont.woff2
└── templates/
    └── base.html
```

We provide compiled CSS and JS (`id7.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (`id7.min.*`). CSS [source maps](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/css-preprocessors) (`id7.*.map`) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools. The FontAwesome icon font is included, as is an optional ID7 theme.

The `id7-bundle.js` file includes dependencies such as jQuery and Bootstrap. The `id7-standalone.js` file doesn't include these, so they will need to be included manually. The dependencies required are:

- [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) >= 1.11.3
- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) >= 3.3.5
- [typeahead.js](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js) >= 0.11.1
- [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) >= 3.10.0
- [Modernizr](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr) >= 2.8.3
- jQuery doubleScroll >= 0.4 (note that this has been patched in the ID7 build to support concatenation)

Internet Explorer 8 (and earlier) support requires:

- [html5shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) >= 3.7.2
