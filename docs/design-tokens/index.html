        Design tokens are an increasingly popular way to describe the various values and measurements that make up
        a standard design. They can be colours, sizes, fonts, and other values.
    </p>
    <p>
        In ID7 we use a set of tokens in the form of LESS variables, which can be adjusted for individual
        applications and sites. However they have a few issues in practice:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no separation between "internal" and "public" variables, so it's difficult to know which
            variables you can reliably use and modify.</li>
        <li>LESS variables are not dynamic, which limits how they can be used to theme and customise components.</li>
        <li>Values tend to be offered individually, but in many cases sets of values go together well. A good example
            is pairs of colours for use as background and text colour - it's hard to know ahead of time if they
            will display with enough contrast to be readable.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
        With this in mind we will gradually be introducing design tokens implemented as CSS custom properties.
        We will clearly document which tokens can be safely used in your own designs, allowing you to implement
        interfaces that respond dynamically to theme changes and colour contrast, and maintain a consistent look and
        feel. Google's <a href="https://m3.material.io/foundations/design-tokens/overview">Material Design</a> site has a
        good overview of the concept.
    </p>

    <p>
        We haven't made any tokens public yet but the first ones will likely be colour pairings to be used together
        as background and foreground colours, which will have guaranteed contrast and automatically re-theme themselves
        when used across different sites.

    <h2>Token naming system</h2>

    Token names will have three parts:

      <ul>
          <li>The brand identifier - in this case <code>w</code> for Warwick</li>
          <li>The token class:
              <ul>
                  <li><code>ref</code> - a reference token usually has a fixed value and wouldn't be used directly</li>
                  <li><code>sys</code> - a system token is semantic and describes a particular use for a value.
                      It is likely to be based on a reference token but will vary depending
                  </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The token description - explaining what it is or what it's for
          </li>
      </ul>

      <p>An example (nonexistant) token name might be <code>--w-sys-foregroundColor</code>.</p>
