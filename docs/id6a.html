<p class="lead">If your application or website previously used the ID6 look and feel with the old Warwick logotype, you
can quickly update it to ID6a which includes the new logotype but keeps all dimensions and behaviour as it is at the
moment.</p>

<p><code>id6a.css</code> is included in the general distribution of ID7, and can be used as an interim measure without
any template changes. This also requires three images, <code>logotype-colour.svg</code>, <code>id6a-logotype.png</code>
and <code>id6a-mobile-sprites.png</code> to be placed in an <code>images/</code> directory as a sibling to the directory
that id6a.css is within.</p>

<p>You may previously have a line of HTML referring to the print logo, which appears when pages are printed. The
<code>src</code> of this image needs changing from <code>warwick_uni_black.gif</code> in ID6 to <code>logotype-colour.svg</code>
in ID6a and setting <code>width="136" height="26"</code>.</p>
