title: Reflow events
slug: examples/reflow

<p>ID7 includes a reflow plugin which fires <samp>id7:reflow</samp> events when the browser is resized in such a way as
    to change the current breakpoint (e.g. from lg to md).
    Event data is an instance of the
<samp>ReflowEvent</samp> class.</p>

<p>We only expect the event to fire when the size of the main container changes. In other words, you'll receive
one event on the transitions from [lg to md, md to sm, sm to xs] and an event every time the browser notifies us of a
size change for the xs size.</p>

<p>Sizes are defined in the aptly-named <samp>screen-sizes.js</samp> source file.</p>

<p>This page shows a message whenever the event is fired. Try resizing your browser:</p>

<textarea readonly></textarea>

<style type="text/css">
    textarea {
        width: 100%;
        font-family: monospace;
        height: 200px;
    }
</style>

<script>
    jQuery(function($) {
        var first = true;
        $(window).on('id7:reflow', function(evData) {
            console.log(evData);
            const $textarea = $("textarea");
            $textarea.val($textarea.val() + (first ? "" : "\n") + "Received id7:reflow at " + (new Date()));
            first = false;
            $textarea.scrollTop($textarea[0].scrollHeight);
        });
    });
</script>
