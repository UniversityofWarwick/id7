<p>By default, ID7 constrains all UI elements into the fixed width container (<code>.id7-fixed-width-container</code>).</p>

<p>
    Some designs call for an approach with the illusion of a fluid width container, but where the content is still
    constrained within a fixed width container for readibility and accessibility purposes. This can then be supplemented
    with large hero imagery that breaks out of the fixed width container entirely.
</p>

<p>
    To enable borderless for a single page, add the <code>.id7-borderless</code> class to the html tag:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html class="id7-borderless"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
    To enable borderless for an entire application, either include <code>id7-borderless.css</code> instead of <code>id7.css</code>, 
    or if you are building your own assets, set the LessCSS variable:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-less">@borderless-container: false; // Set to true to have a borderless container</code></pre>

<p>
    With a borderless container, the <code>.id7-left-border</code> and <code>.id7-right-border</code>s are hidden so
    no imagery is needed. All imagery must now support up to <code>3000px</code> wide, including the masthead image.
    You may consider using a gradient rather than an image for the masthead, both to save page weight and to reduce
    the need to generate such images:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">.id7-utility-masthead {
    background-image: linear-gradient(120deg,#0e7191 20%,#6ee6de 70%,#1b7c97);
}</code></pre>

<h2>Breaking out of the container</h2>

<p>
    You can use elements with the class <code>.id7-container-breakout</code> to have elements that are flush to the
    entire width of the screen (note that you may lose between 10px and 20px at each side of this due to browser
    limitations when there is a vertical scrollbar).
</p>

<p>
    You can use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/components/#responsive-embed">Bootstrap responsive embeds</a>
    to embed content based on an aspect ratio, rather than specifying an explicit width and height. For example:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class="id7-container-breakout">
    &lt;p class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-3by1">
        &lt;img class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://picsum.photos/3000/1000">
    &lt;/p>
&lt;/div></code></pre>

<p>
    As well as the default <code>.embed-responsive-16by9</code> and <code>embed-responsive-4by3</code> aspect ratios
    supported by Bootstrap, ID7 adds three others:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>.embed-responsive-5by4</code></li>
    <li><code>.embed-responsive-3by2</code></li>
    <li><code>.embed-responsive-3by1</code></li>
</ul>
