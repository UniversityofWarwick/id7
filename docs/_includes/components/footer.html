<h3>Site footer</h3>

<p>Typical content might be contact information and social media links. The content of this section should not change across a site.</p>

<h3>Application footer</h3>

<p>The application footer contains common links that all Warwick apps should include - the small print.
Typical links are for application platform information, copyright, terms of use, privacy policy, cookies, and accessibility.</p>

<p>For applications hosted by IT Services, it is usually appropriate to link to the relevant Sitebuilder pages. You will need to link to
vendor-specific pages if the application has differing policies. <b>If you link to central pages, you must ensure that your application
does follow these policies and procedures without conflict.</b></p>
