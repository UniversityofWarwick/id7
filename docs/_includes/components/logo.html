<h2 id="logo">Logo</h2>

<p class="lead">The Warwick logo should appear in the top left of the masthead, "bleeding" from the image behind the utility bar.</p>

<p>The logo should always link to the University of Warwick homepage (http://warwick.ac.uk), <em>not</em> the homepage of the current application.</p>
