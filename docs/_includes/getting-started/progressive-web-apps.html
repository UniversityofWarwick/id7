<h2 id="pwa" class="page-header">Progressive Web Apps</h2>
<p>We've included icons to help you set up your application as a Progressive Web App (PWA) if you want. You'll find them
in the images folder with the form <em>pwa-icon-[size]x[size].png</em>.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a PWA manifest.json file you can update and use for your application:</p>

<pre>
{
  "short_name": "ID7",
  "name": "ID7 - University of Warwick brand",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/dist/images/pwa-icon-512x512.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "purpose": "any maskable"
    },
    {
      "src": "/dist/images/pwa-icon-192x192.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "purpose": "any maskable"
    }
  ],
  "id": "/",
  "start_url": "/",
  "background_color": "#A499F4",
  "display": "standalone",
  "scope": "/",
  "theme_color": "#A499F4",
  "description": "Standalone app for University of Warwick's ID7 brand",
}
</pre>

<p>There's more you can do with PWAs if you're intending for people to actually install your app. See <a href="https://web.dev/learn/pwa?hl=en">web.dev's guidelines</a> for more.</p>
